# CTFd-Subflags

## Description
This Plguin for CTFd allows you to add additional optional subflags under above the main flag of a challenge. This is used to guide players through large challenges and lets them track their process within the challenge. 

As of now all Subflags are purely optional leaving the player the option to solve a challenge how ever they see fit. Addtionionally hints can be attached to a subflag making it clearer which parts of the challenge they are helping with.

## Installation
Just copy the subflags folder into the CTFd Plugin directoy normally found under `.../CTFd/CTFd/plugins/`
Then restart the CTFd Platform and a new challenge typ with the name subflags should appear.
